**squardot-aruco-toolkit**: is a Python package that provides functionality for generating and detecting ArUco markers using OpenCV.

The "squardot-aruco-toolkit" package provides a set of tools and functionalities for working with ArUco markers, a type of 2D barcode widely used in computer vision applications. With this package, you can easily generate ArUco markers, detect them in images or video streams, and perform various tasks related to marker detection and recognition.

## Features:
- Generation of ArUco markers with customizable properties.
- Detection of ArUco markers using images, cameras, and scanners.
- Support for different marker dictionaries and types.
- Identification of the ArUco marker type.
- Integration with OpenCV for efficient computer vision operations.
